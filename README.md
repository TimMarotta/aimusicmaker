# Agent Environment Description:
- Fully observable - the agent will always start with an empty track, and would be aware of any notes that have been added at any point
- Single agent - a single agent will be creating the music. Later on, we might try creating multiple agents that work together as a band.
- Multi-agent - multiple agents representing different instruments work together to make a track (v2)
- Deterministic vs stochastic - anything in the environment is based on the agent so it makes it deterministic
- Episodic vs sequential - could be episodic if the agent is making decisions on its own (v1). Has the possibility to be sequential progression with a given task (v2), but episodic in each task that produces a track. 
- Static vs dynamic -  Static, the music file/track isnâ€™t randomly changing
- Known vs unknown - Known since the results for all actions are known to the agent.
-  Discrete vs continuous -  discrete since finite possibilities are accessible
